# sliding-tile-solver: State-Space Search Sliding-Tile Puzzle Solver
Bart Massey 2021

This codebase is a Rust implementation of State Space search
for the Sliding Tile Puzzle problem. It currently implements
A\* search with various heuristics â€” further algorithms and
heuristics are planned.

The code is basically undocumented and poorly tested.  Run
the program with

    cargo run --release -- --help

to get information on arguments.

The directory `p/` contains a few sample puzzles to try
out. On my box, `p/p2-15-60.txt` runs in about 15 seconds
with the `interference` heuristic.

Huge thanks to Grant Baker and Tu Vu for providing some of
the research, consulting and advising on this as we studied
the problem together.
